<p>A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant.<br/> The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis, which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk. Planets grow in this disk by the gradual accumulation of material driven by gravity, </br/>a process called accretion. The Solar System has at least eight planets: the terrestrial planets Mercury,<br/> Venus, Earth, and Mars, and the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. 
    (When the term "planet" is applied more broadly, these eight uncontroversial planets can be distinguished by calling them "major planets".)<br />
     These planets each rotate around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole. All the major planets of the Solar System other than Mercury possess a considerable atmosphere, and some share such features as ice caps,
      seasons, volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.<br /> Apart from Venus and Mars, the Solar System planets generate magnetic fields,
       and all the major planets except Venus and Mercury have natural><a href="#"
